- in the middle: current hack night event version (fun fact: the moons are a marquee 🌝), current time in [lightning time](https://github.com/purduehackers/time)
- at the right: the latest 3 posts showing what people are working on during the event. you add to this section by going to the `#hack-night` channel in our discord during hack night and posting any image with a picture.
  - to change the fish of the day, post a picture in `#hack-night` with the caption "fish of the day"
  - also see [nightcrawler](https://github.com/purduehackers/night-crawler), which powers this
  
## what is hack night?

GREAT QUESTION. hack night is an event that we run every friday night from 7pm to whenever the last person leaves. the goal of hack night is to give people uninterrupted time to work on personal, creative projects. people have already shipped some really cool stuff at hack night, and it's a LOT of fun. if you go to purdue and haven't been to a hack night yet, you should 1000% go to one—check out the [events site](https://events.purduehackers.com) or [join our discord](https://puhack.horse/discord) to find out when the next one is happening. 🌙
